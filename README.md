What is Planq
Planq is a scalable, high-throughput Proof-of-Stake blockchain that is fully compatible and interoperable with Ethereum. It's built using the Cosmos SDK (opens new window)which runs on top of Tendermint Core (opens new window)consensus engine.

Planq allows for running vanilla Ethereum as a Cosmos (opens new window)application-specific blockchain. This allows developers to have all the desired features of Ethereum, while at the same time, benefit from Tendermintâ€™s PoS implementation. Also, because it is built on top of the Cosmos SDK, it will be able to exchange value with the rest of the Cosmos Ecosystem through the Inter Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC).

Planq is the very first cryptocurrency to keep mobile platform usability at heart, taking a step away from dependency on desktop services. Users in developing countries will now be able to lend and borrow crypto using their phones, rather than relying on a desktop computer system. This should have profound impacts on the individuals and the overall crypto ecosystem.
